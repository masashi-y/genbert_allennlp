# GenBERT

AllenNLP wrapper of 
[GenBERT](https://github.com/ag1988/injecting_numeracy).


## Dependencies

The latest version of AllenNLP (maybe version >= 2.0 should be fine).

```sh
pip install allennlp allennlp-models jsonlines
```

## Dataset preprocessing

Create `datasets` directory and expand there [the DROP dataset](https://allennlp.org/drop.html).

Then, preprocess the dataset json files into pickled ones:

```sh
python -m genbert.datasets.drop configs/drop_dataset.jsonnet
```

which process the files specified in `train_data_path` and `validation_data_path` in the jsonnet file and can be equivalently written as:

```sh
for target in train dev; do
    python -m genbert.datasets.drop config/drop_dataset.jsonnet \
        --input-file datasets/drop_dataset/drop_dataset_${target}.json \
        --output-file datasets/drop_dataset/drop_dataset_${target}.pickle
done
```


## Training

```sh
env \
  seed=42 \
  train_data_path=datasets/drop_dataset/drop_dataset_train.pickle  \
  validation_data_path=datasets/drop_dataset/drop_dataset_dev.pickle  \
  devices="0,1,2,3"  \      # use four devices
  pretrained_weights=""  \
 allennlp train --serialization-dir results --include-package genbert configs/genbert.jsonnet
```

You can do `Ctrl-C` to interrupt the training loop, at which the `model.tar.gz` is created with the best performing weights until that time.

## Make predictions

When the training has completed, you'll find `model.tar.gz` in the result directory.

With that file, you can perform prediction on test inputs using the best performing weights.

```sh
allennlp predict --include-package genbert --cuda-device 1 --use-dataset-reader --output-file results/output.jsonl results/model.tar.gz datasets/drop_dataset/drop_dataset_dev.pickle
```

Or you can calculate the performance scores by:

```sh
allennlp evaluate --include-package genbert --cuda-device 1 results/model.tar.gz datasets/drop_dataset/drop_dataset_dev.pickle
```

You can use the original `drop_dataset_dev.json` file as input by changing the `validation_dataset_reader` value in the `genbert.jsonnet` accordingly.

## Using pre-trained models

To use pre-trained weights in the original repository,
create a `tar.gz` file containing the pretrained weights (renamed as `weights.th`), `config.json`, and `vocabulary/`, where the latter two files are created in the `results` directory when running training.

```sh
$ tar tvf ~/work/genbert/model.tar.gz
 config.json
 weights.th
 vocabulary/
 vocabulary/.lock
 vocabulary/non_padded_namespaces.txt
```
